        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Cloud Aster is an animation studio based in Sudan.</p>
        <p>
          We designed and developed a website where they can sell their brand
          and showcase their work.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Challenges and Constrains</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Working with the studio’s artists and animators to create the
            website’s art, optimizing it and transforming the design to
            complement it
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>

        <p>Most of the work was done remotely because of COVID restrictions.</p>
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          After all research is done and info is collected, we conducted
          analysis and shared the results with the teams in the shape of
          prototypes.
        </p>

          We created a well-rounded design system that matches the brand
          identity and tone.
