        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          After the Sudanese revolution and the palpable effect it had on forms
          of expression, Sudan Moves was initiated with the aim to discuss the
          role of art during crisis, and to bring artists and creatives together
          in both Sudan and Germany. It’s a platform for exchange, networking,
          communication and coproduction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project was coordinated and funded by the Goethe-Institut Sudan in
          collaboration with the Kunsthalle am Hamburger Platz/Weißensee Academy
          of Arts, Art Kanoon Publishing House, ElMastaba TV, The Urban Episode
          and Rift Digital Lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          We set out to create a design system to ensure Sudan Moves encompasses
          best-in-class usability and aesthetics across all devices, then went
          on to developed the platform.

        <h2>Key Challenges and Constrains</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coordinating and taking feedback from all parties involved into one
            cohesive vision
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrating a virtual exhibition developed by another team into the
            platform
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <img src="/sudanmoves/design_process.png" alt="Design Process" />
        <p>
          With the political situation in Sudan at the time, COVID-19 pandemic
          and lack of mobility; the design process was done remotely from
          beginning to end. Starting with defining the problem and ideating
          solutions, then conducting the necessary research.
        </p>
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          After all research is done and info is collected, we conducted
          analysis and shared the results with the teams in the shape of
          prototypes.

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          We created a well-rounded design system that matches the brand
          identity and tone.
